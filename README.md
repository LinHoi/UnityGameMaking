# Create Unity Games
## PacMan
Creating Games  always generates much pleasure than playing games. It may be a good way to learn program through creating games.There is the first game ,PacMan that I made during learing Unity. It's simple with short codes. You can find the source code of Pacman under directory: "Pacman/Assets/Scripts". 
The playable exe with resource is under directory "Pacman/OutPut_EXE".It's available for Windows OS.Just  have fun.
